## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

My current goal is compare alimentary poverty and extreme poverty across Mexico. I want to show that there are cases such as Chiapas where having the highest rates of extreme poverty does not indicate having high alimentary poverty rates. Moreover, I want to show that Mexico has overall done well reducing extreme poverty and alimentary poverty since 2016.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

No, I have cleaned all the data. The only reason I could face data challenges is if I decide to add one variable that is not in my current dataset

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal

Bars plot: I have two different plots (one for alimentary poverty and one for extreme poverty). Both of them are faceted by year (so they are 8 in total, we have data for 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022). My goal with this set of charts is to show that some states that has the highest poverty rates such as Chiapas have normal alimentary poverty rates. Moreover, this charts show that almost every state has consistently decreased both rates from 2016 to 2022.

Points plot: I want to show the difference between poverty rates from 2022 and 2016 by state. I believe these plots ease the understanding of data.

Choropleth maps: I want to show poverty rates using these maps to show that highest rates are concentrated in particular geographic areas of the country. I am still not able to facet them by year, it is my next step

Lines: Show the poverty rates evolution throuhg time for the 5 states that had the highest rate of poverty in 2022. My plot is still missing one vertical line that shows new monetary transfers policies adopted by the Mexican government in 2018

Scatter plot: Show that there are some cases where having extreme poverty does not correlate with having high alimentary poverty rates

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)

I think an article would be the best way so I can give more context about Mexico and this situation
