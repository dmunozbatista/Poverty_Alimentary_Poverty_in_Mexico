clean_dataset.csv consists of collapsed data by state. CONEVAL provides one dataset for 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022 that uses households as observations. We used the expansion factor and the collapsed the data to have state data.

debt_clean and spenditure_clean are clean versions of the data obtained from the Central Bank of Mexico (Banxico). Both of them includes monetary data adjusted by inflation using data from the INEGI (national insitute of statistics in Mexico).
